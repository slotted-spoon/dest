# README

This app is a mock-up for a User Experience Design course at Olin College of Engineering. It is a looks-like-acts-like prototype for navigating an indoor space.

To make this app work, build it on your Android phone and connect an Xbox controller via BlueTooth. The user should select a destination from the first screen and hit the arrow. From this screen, they can swipe back to edit the destination. After hitting the 'go' button, they will enter navigation mode. From here, the Xbox controller will act as the automation. The top left trigger button will cause a 'heartbeat pulse' as long as the vibrate setting remains. The bottom right trigger progresses the screen with a single long buzz (cancelling the heartbeat). The holding down the bottom left trigger will create an angry buzzing sound.

At any point, hitting the 'x' floating button will cancel navigation.
